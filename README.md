### Face
A Web Interface for Jarvy

This interface aims to provide access to [Jarvy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jarvy) through simple queries. It basically works like a 
search engine, you ask a question, Jarvy interprets this question and tries to answer it. For issues related to Jarvy, please use it's 
[own repo](https://github.com/jarvy/jarvy) as this repo is dedicated to the web interface.

#### Roadmap

- The first milestone is to provide a simple view that communicates with Jarvy.
- Current stack in mind is using Django as the scaffold and AngularJS for the front end.
