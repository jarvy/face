# Face
A Web Interface for Jarvy

This interface aims to provide access to [Jarvy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jarvy) through simple queries. It basically works like a search engine, you ask a question, Jarvy interprets this question and tries to answer it.

# Roadmap

- The first milestone is to provide a simple view that communicates with Jarvy.

# Contributing

- Anyone is welcome to contribute. Just fork the repo, make changes and send a pull request.
